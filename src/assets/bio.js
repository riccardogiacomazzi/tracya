  text: "Tracya is a project that combines electronic music and visual arts. The distinctive blend of ambient, dub, and acid elements allows the artist to create imaginary soundscapes and layers, transporting the listener to a dystopian dimension where sound acts as a force that propels them into orbit. The mix of genres typical of his compositions ranges from downtempo to techno, for high-speed sets that magnetically capture the dancefloor. The deeply rooted glitch imprint of the visual sets perfectly blends with the sound, creating a pattern of abstract images and shapes in constant and unpredictable evolution.",
  visualArt:
    "Tracya's visual art is deeply rooted in glitch art and takes inspiration from corrupted images and noisy textures. In order to achieve his aestethic, he uses a wide range of devices and tools such as: analog and digital cameras, old camcorders, DIY analog video generators, and TouchDesigner.",
